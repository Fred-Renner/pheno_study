# Phenomenology Study
##Based on previous Oxford hh->4b Code

The original code is available at [HERE](https://github.com/beojan/oxford-hh4b-pheno-code)

There are 3 folders for each analysis done by this code: that is __Resolved__, __Intermediate__, __Boosted__.

Each analysis can run invidividually. In the future a script running all of them simultaneously will be added.
